## Favorite code Snippets

* This is an sync function that returns the employee and their manager all the way up to the board of directors

```javascript                       


async function getOneStepUp(id) {
    let listOfCommand = []; // Array for list of employee and managers
    let inLoop = true; // Boolean to stay in loop
    let user; // Var to set current employee
    
    while(inLoop){
        // Sets user to employee of id we passed in
        user = await db.Employee.findOne({_id: id});

        // Pushes employee to array
        listOfCommand.push(user)

        // Checks for manager
        if(user.manager === null || user.manager === undefined){
            // If no manager then break loop
            inLoop = false
        }else{
            // Sets id to manager id if manager exists
            id = user.manager
        }
    }

    // Returns Array
    return listOfCommand;
}
